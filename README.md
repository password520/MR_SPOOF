### what do you need to run this program ?

you will need:

the netifaces module
the scapy module
```

### Common issues

__I am running my machine on a VMware, and the script doesn't seems to send any packet proprely.__ 
> Running a pentest machine on a virtual machine can be very tricky when it comes to network attacks and check if your VM is connected hrough wifi and not emulated cable. You can also install scapy using another method than pip3 [here](https://scapy.net/download/). 

__Can i try to run the program on windows ?__
> No, sorry.
